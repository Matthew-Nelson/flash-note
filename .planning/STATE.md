## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: PROMPT-01/02/03 assigned to Phase 6 (PHI Storage) because template-driven generation restructures the prompt system
- [Roadmap]: BILL-05 (failed payment emails) assigned to Phase 8 (Retention) because it is a retention mechanism, not a launch-gate billing item
- [Roadmap]: MON-07/08/09 (monitoring ops) assigned to Phase 10 because audit sink and alerts harden what earlier phases build
- [Roadmap]: Phases 1 and 2 can execute in parallel (no dependency between UI polish and Pino logging)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Account deletion conflicts with PHI retention (HIPAA 6-year requirement vs CCPA). Requires legal counsel before implementation. Does not block any current phase.
- [Research]: HIPAA proposed rule may mandate MFA. Auth schema should be MFA-extensible. Does not block current phases but affects Phase 6+ design.
- [Research]: Cloud Run connection pool exhaustion risk under autoscaling. Must validate pool sizing during Phase 4 staging verification.
